          `Welcome to our example service for Deposit payments on Golem.
          We're glad to have you here. 
          This version will show you step by step how Golem deposit payments work and how You can benefit from it on your very own service.  \n This example service is inspired by a real-world service called VirusTotal. VirusTotal is well well-renowned service that analyzes suspicious files and URLs by running them through multiple antivirus engines and URL scanners to detect malware and malicious content. You can access the original service under this [Link](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload).  \nOf course, our service is a little bit less ambitious as it aims to present how deposit payments can be utilized by the Golem community. Consequently, our service will let you scan files on the ClamAV engine and give the results of such scans.  \nLast but not least, we are utilizing the Holesky testnet for this example. It means that you need a Metamask wallet with both Holesky tETH and Holesky tGLM. To obtain Holesky tETH feel free to use one of the following faucets:  \n[Faucet 1](https://holesky-faucet.pk910.de/)  \n[Faucet 2](https://faucet.quicknode.com/ethereum/holesky)  \n[Faucet 3](https://faucet.chainstack.com/holesky-testnet-faucet)  \n[Faucet 4](https://www.holeskyfaucet.io/)  \nAfter You obtain some tETH, you can request tGLM tokens from this Smart Contract by calling the "Create" function:  \n[GLM Faucet Smart Contract](https://holesky.etherscan.io/address/0xface100969ff47eb58d2cf603321b581a84bceac) When You are ready to start, click the "Connect Wallet" button. This button will initialize the following steps of the process:  \n-Connect Your Metamask Wallet with Web Service \n-Register Your wallet to the Service via SIWE (Sign-In with Ethereum) standard  \nHave fun!`

The deposit consists of three values:
amount: that is the amount of GLM tokens You are willing to spend on the service. This amount will be locked so that there is a limited risk of the user running out without paying :) That value should be provided by the User.
fee: that is a fee that will be sent to the Service Owner. In this instance, it is Golem Factory. However, for Your own service, it will be You! It is not mandatory but can be utilized to make your service profitable or at least refund the costs of running it. In normal conditions, this value should be set by the Service user. However, in this example, we make it editable so that You can play around with it.
timestamp: it points to the place in time till which Deposit will be held on the Smart Contract. As already mentioned this mechanism is chosen to limit the risk of people running away without paying for service.
